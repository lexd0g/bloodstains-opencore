# bloodstains-opencore
This is an OpenCore EFI folder for my personal computer *bloodstains*, for use with a Hackintosh (specifically High Sierra, but Sierra might work too).

# Relevant specs:
**CPU:** Ryzen 5 3600
**GPU:** GeForce GTX 1070
**Motherboard:** MSI B450M PRO-VDH MAX
**Boot disk:** Kingston A2000 500GB (NVMe)
If you have similar specs (mainly the motherboard), you should be able to copy this EFI with minimal to no modification.
