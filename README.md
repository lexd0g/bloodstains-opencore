# bloodstains-opencore
This is an OpenCore EFI folder for my personal computer *bloodstains*, for use with a Hackintosh (specifically High Sierra, but Sierra might work too).  
This is missing the OpenCore EFI executable and the OpenCore resources, so you'll need to grab those from the (OpenCore repository)[https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases], as well as probably update everything as this is already a few months out of date at the time of writing this.

# Relevant specs:
**CPU:** Ryzen 5 3600  
**GPU:** GeForce GTX 1070  
**Motherboard:** MSI B450M PRO-VDH MAX  
**Boot disk:** Kingston A2000 500GB (NVMe)  
If you have similar specs (mainly the motherboard), you should be able to copy this EFI with minimal to no modification.
